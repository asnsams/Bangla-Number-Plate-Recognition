# Bangla-Number-Plate-Recognition
 
This is a <b>MATLAB</b> implementation of Bangla Number Plate Recognition. 
This will take a Bangla Number Plate as input and use segmentation to extract the information from the number plate. </n>

<b>Limitation</b>
1. This is only works for a cropped number plate. See the sample files for better understanding for what types of number plates it can extract info from. 
2. It can not extract number plate information from a image where number plate is not cropped. 
3. Only works for Dhaka Metro. Will not work for others.
